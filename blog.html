                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <div class="date">07/19/2019</div>
                <p>This week we prepared our sites for launch by fixing HTML, CSS, and accessibility validation errors.
                    We also made any last minute
                    changes to our coded sites. Some students submitted custom UI designs and prototypes as optional
                    contest submissions that we wera able to vote on. We
                    also created custom logos using our initials in Adobe Illustrator. Finally, we did a quick review of
                    what we learned this summer and had an award ceremony at the final class to celebrate everyone's web
                    sites and
                    designs.</p>

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">07/12/2019</div>
                <p>This week we learned about design patterns (e.g. image galleries, breadcrumb navs, modals, carousels,
                    slideshows, etc.). We then coded an custom image gallery of UI designs created in XD and custom
                    thumbnail images created in Photoshop. We then added an overlay lightbox modal using Fancybox. We
                    also took photos around
                    campus and drew logo sketches of our initials.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/05/2019</div>
                <p>This week I used Adobe XD to create sub pages that are linked together to form a multi-page
                    prototype. I also learned about different web design terms (e.g. IA, UX, and UI) and different
                    planning exercies and deliverables that one can create as part of the web design process, such as
                    site maps, wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups. We also began planning for the final
                    project.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">06/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week I learned how to use Photoshop to edit raster images. I also used Photoshop to clean up a
                    photo of a sketch that I drew that I then converted into a vector SVG using Adobe Illustrator. Then
                    I learned how to use Adobe XD to design a website without coding. I created a Home page,
                    About page, and a Blog page that closely resembles the site that I coded during the first 2 weeks of
                    class. I also learned how to create and share an interactive prototype using Adobe XD. Check out
